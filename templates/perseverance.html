                Friends of our family recently asked me what my (our?) "core values" were. 
                A question I don't get every day. What traits do I hold myself accountable to, 
                what traits would I like to instill in my children as a strong foundation?
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                "Perseverance" is what I responded with.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                I'm not sure what kind of picture this paints of me, but it was an honest answer. 
                First what came to my mind. Would "Integrity" have been better? Honesty? Service? Empathy?

            <p class="body-text">
                If there's one thing I can point to about successes in my life is that it was about 
                tirelessly persisting despite challenges and setbacks, informed by a clear view of 
                what ultimate success could look like.

            <h2 class="section-title">Running Toward a Dream</h2>
            
            <p class="body-text">
                I had dreamed about running ultra-marathon distances for more than a year since 
                finishing the LA marathon in 2023.
            </p>
            
            <p class="body-text">
                I reminded myself not to succumb to comfort when my alarm clock rang at 4:45am 
                on Saturday morning to attempt my first 60k. I had not signed up for a race, and 
                there wouldn't be any spectators along the route. I just wanted to achieve a goal 
                important to me. I took my bag of gummy bears, a bottle of Gatorade, a credit card 
                to pay for supplies along the route and started running from my house in the dark—knowing 
                that it would be a hot day and that I'd better start going.

            <h3>The Point</h3>
            <p>
                My sister later asked me what the "point" is of running a distance like that. 
                I didn't have a good answer, apart from thinking that a life lived well is a 
                life where I continuously expanded the outer perimeter of what I could have 
                dreamed is possible.
