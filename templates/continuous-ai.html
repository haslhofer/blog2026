                Generative AI means things that were always possible at a small scale now become 
                practical to automate at a massive scale. Sometimes a change in scale is a change 
                in principle. The question isn't how to get users from 10 to 20 AI queries a day—it's 
                how to build for a world where AI reasons continuously, every few hundred milliseconds, 
                across all modalities.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                This is an argument for working backwards from the future of always-on AI rather than 
                incrementally grinding forward from today's interaction patterns.

        <!-- The Anti-Lock Brakes Analogy -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Anti-Lock Brakes Analogy</h2>
            
            <p class="body-text">
                Before anti-lock braking systems, stopping safely on ice or in rain required genuine skill. 
                Drivers had to learn "threshold braking"—applying pressure just below the point where wheels 
                lock up, repeatedly pumping the pedal. It took practice. It required staying calm under 
                pressure. Many people never mastered it.
            </p>
            
            <p class="body-text">
                Then ABS arrived. Sensors monitored wheel speed continuously. Actuators modulated brake 
                pressure hundreds of times per second. The system reacted faster than any human could. 
                Suddenly, the skill didn't matter. Even in harsh conditions, you could drive with confidence. 
                The continuous sensing and acting eliminated the need for human expertise.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                This is the trajectory for AI-assisted productivity. Today, being productive requires 
                genuine skill—prioritization, time management, knowing what to ignore, remembering follow-ups. 
                These are learnable but effortful. When AI reasons continuously across your calendar, email, 
                tasks, and context, it can handle the "braking" for you. The skill of productivity management 
                becomes as obsolete as threshold braking.

            <p class="body-text">
                The mistake is to start from where we are and inch forward. Right now, even a highly engaged 
                user runs maybe 10-ish queries a day with Copilot. The incrementalist asks: "How do we get 
                them to 20? To 50?" This is the wrong question.
            </p>
            
            <p class="body-text">
                The right question is: "What does a world look like where AI reasons every few hundred 
                milliseconds, across all modalities?" Start there. Work backwards. Design for that world, 
                not for marginal improvements to today's interaction patterns.

            <p class="body-text">
                Consider planning a trip to India. With a human assistant like Mykaela, you provide: 
                travel dates, starting point (LA, not Seattle), goals, and rough time allocation. 
                Three days later, you board a plane with a binder containing every detail organized—
                flights, hotels, activities, reservations, contingencies.
            </p>
            
            <p class="body-text">
                What would it take to replicate that with AI, at similar levels of precision and 
                personalization? The answer isn't "better prompts" or "more queries." It's continuous 
                reasoning: AI that knows your preferences, monitors availability, tracks price changes, 
                anticipates conflicts, and assembles the binder without being asked step-by-step.

            <p class="body-text">
                This is the anti-lock brakes of travel planning. The skill of being an excellent trip 
                organizer—knowing which sites to check, when to book, how to sequence activities—becomes 
                unnecessary. The system handles it continuously.

            <h3>The Shift</h3>
            <p>
                We're at an inflection point similar to the introduction of ABS. The technology exists. 
                The economics work. The question is whether we'll design systems that assume continuous 
                AI reasoning, or keep building for a world of discrete queries and manual skill.
            </p>
            <p>
                Work backwards from the future. Build for the world where AI reasons every few hundred 
                milliseconds. That's where we're headed—and the sooner we design for it, the sooner 
                productivity management becomes as effortless as braking in the rain.
