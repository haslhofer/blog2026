                7 European Cities Compared for Family Relocation · 2026

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="intro">
            <p class="lead drop-cap">
                Finding the right place to raise a family of five in Europe means balancing competing priorities:
                green landscapes or Mediterranean sunshine, world-class skiing or beach living, affordability or
                luxury real estate, proximity to international schools or acceptance of a commute. After analyzing
                climate data, school options, skiing access, and costs across seven finalist cities, clear patterns
                emerge—and difficult tradeoffs become unavoidable.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                Como · Canet de Mar · Platja d'Aro · A Coruña · Málaga · Antibes · Nice

        <!-- The Green vs Dry Divide -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Green Divide</h2>

            <p class="body-text">
                Only two cities offer the lush, verdant landscapes that signal abundant rainfall and year-round
                greenery. <strong>Como, Italy</strong> receives between 1,300 and 1,834mm of rain annually—making it
                one of Italy's rainiest cities and creating the kind of Alpine-protected microclimate where
                vegetation thrives. An hour north, the Alps rise immediately accessible for skiing. Lake Como
                itself delivers luxury real estate and that particular Italian combination of elegance and ease.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                On Spain's Atlantic coast, <strong>A Coruña</strong> captures 1,240mm of rain each year. The city
                sits on a promontory facing the open ocean, where Atlantic depressions bring the same green climate
                that defines Ireland or Brittany. The Spanish call this region "Green Spain," and A Coruña proves
                why: verdant cliffside landscapes, mild temperatures, and four international schools—including one
                with tuition starting at just €4,190 per year and offering a 70% discount for a fourth child.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                The other five cities fail the green test. The Costa Brava towns of <strong>Canet de Mar</strong> and
                <strong>Platja d'Aro</strong> receive only 590-700mm annually—Mediterranean climate code for hot, dry
                summers and brown hillsides by August. <strong>Málaga</strong> is even worse at 481-581mm, recording
                zero millimeters of rain in July. The French Riviera cities of <strong>Nice</strong> and
                <strong>Antibes</strong> sit in between at 767-894mm—better than Spain but still Mediterranean,
                with only 111 rainy days per year and 31mm of rain in July.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Skiing Advantage -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The 90-Minute Alps Advantage</h2>

            <p class="body-text">
                If skiing access matters, the French Riviera delivers an unbeatable proposition: <strong>90 minutes
                from the Mediterranean coast to proper Alpine skiing</strong>. Nice and Antibes both offer direct
                bus service to Isola 2000 (altitude 1,800-2,610m) and Auron (1,600m), making "from the Riviera to
                the Alps before lunch" a genuine possibility rather than marketing copy.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Como matches this with approximately one hour to multiple ski resorts in the Italian and Swiss Alps—
                Piani di Bobbio, Monte Sighignola, and quick access to the Engadin Valley. The Costa Brava towns
                reach the Pyrenees in about two hours, delivering good skiing but requiring more commitment.
                Málaga's Sierra Nevada sits two hours away but offers limited facilities compared to proper Alpine
                resorts.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Then there's A Coruña, where skiing means a 599-mile, 10-hour drive to Baqueira-Beret in the
                Pyrenees. This isn't "weekend ski trips"—this is "we don't ski." For families where mountains
                matter, A Coruña's otherwise compelling combination of green climate and affordability collapses
                under this single dealbreaker.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- The School Question -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Schools: In the City or Worth the Commute?</h2>

            <p class="body-text">
                Six of the seven cities offer international schools within city limits. Como has the International
                School of Como (€13,410-€24,050) with bus service throughout the region. The Costa Brava towns
                each have one school: Canet de Mar hosts International School Maresme (€9,278-€20,115), while
                Platja d'Aro is home to International School Costa Brava (€9,350-€14,500)—notably more affordable.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                A Coruña offers four international schools, with Coruña British International School leading at
                €4,190-€6,190 annually—the lowest tuition of any city examined. Málaga spreads 10+ schools across
                the Costa del Sol (€5,655-€15,900). Nice dominates with 6+ options including the International
                School of Nice (€6,000-€17,290) and École Montessori (€12,700).
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Only <strong>Antibes</strong> requires a commute: 15-20 minutes to either Centre International de
                Valbonne (€9,000-€16,500) or Mougins British International School in the Sophia Antipolis technology
                park. Both schools are excellent, serving 46 nationalities at Valbonne and offering British National
                Curriculum at Mougins. But the commute is real—not in the city, not walkable, not optional.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Cost Reality -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Cost Spectrum</h2>

            <p class="body-text">
                Monthly costs for a family of four (excluding rent) span from €1,580 to €3,737—a difference that
                compounds aggressively over years. The <strong>Costa Brava towns</strong> (Canet de Mar, Platja d'Aro)
                lead at €1,580 per month. A Coruña follows at €2,561, then Málaga at €2,557. Como lands at $3,109
                (roughly €2,900). The French Riviera cities—both Nice and Antibes—top the list at €3,737 monthly,
                plus substantially higher rents in one of Europe's most expensive real estate markets.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                School tuition follows a similar pattern. A Coruña's €4,190-€6,190 represents the floor, with
                generous sibling discounts (70% for a fourth child). Málaga and Platja d'Aro cluster around
                €5,655-€15,900 and €9,350-€14,500 respectively. Como (€13,410-€24,050), Canet de Mar
                (€9,278-€20,115), and the French Riviera schools (€6,000-€17,290 at Nice, €9,000-€16,500 at
                Valbonne) occupy the middle to upper range.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Over five years, including three children in school, A Coruña costs approximately €140,000-210,000
                total. Bilbao and Como land around €170,000-250,000. The French Riviera approaches €300,000-400,000
                for the same period. These aren't rounding errors—they're different financial realities.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Luxury Real Estate -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Where Luxury Lives</h2>

            <p class="body-text">
                Four cities stand out for exceptional luxury real estate markets. <strong>Lake Como</strong> has
                been synonymous with Italian elegance for centuries—waterfront villas with private docks, historic
                properties with terraced gardens, and the kind of understated wealth that doesn't need to announce
                itself. Property prices rank fourth-highest in Italy, but the market delivers genuine luxury rather
                than tourist markup.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                The <strong>French Riviera</strong>—both Nice and Antibes—operates at a different scale entirely.
                Nice offers world-class urban luxury with panoramic sea views and proximity to Nice Côte d'Azur
                International Airport. Antibes centers on Cap d'Antibes, an exclusive peninsula where "luxury real
                estate" understates the concentration of serious wealth. Properties here compete with Monaco for
                exclusivity, though at marginally lower entry points.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>Málaga</strong> and the broader Costa del Sol deliver a different flavor: resort luxury
                rather than old-money elegance. Marbella, Estepona, and the coastal developments offer excellent
                properties with 325 days of annual sunshine, golf course access, and an international community
                that skews toward second-home buyers and retirees. It's luxury, but with a lifestyle-resort character.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                The Costa Brava towns (Canet de Mar, Platja d'Aro) offer beach properties and some luxury options
                at €2,500-€3,000/m², while A Coruña provides affordable real estate more than luxury—though Atlantic
                views and historic architecture deliver their own appeal.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Decision Framework -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Decision Framework</h2>

            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>If green climate is non-negotiable,</strong> only Como and A Coruña qualify. Como delivers
                Alpine lake beauty, one-hour skiing access, and Italian lifestyle at moderate-to-high cost. A Coruña
                offers Atlantic coast living, exceptional affordability (€140,000-210,000 over five years), and the
                lowest tuition rates—but skiing becomes impossible at 10 hours away.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>If skiing access matters most,</strong> Nice and Antibes dominate with 90-minute access to
                proper Alps. Como follows at one hour. The Costa Brava towns and Málaga require two hours but deliver
                good Pyrenees or Sierra Nevada access. A Coruña fails completely on this dimension.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>If affordability drives the decision,</strong> A Coruña wins on total cost (€2,561/month +
                €4,190-€6,190 tuition + 70% discount for fourth child). The Costa Brava towns and Málaga follow as
                affordable Mediterranean options, accepting that they sacrifice green climate for sunshine. Como
                occupies middle ground. The French Riviera represents the expensive end—world-class lifestyle at
                world-class prices.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                <strong>If school selection and quality matter,</strong> Nice leads with 6+ options, followed by
                Málaga's 10+ schools across the Costa del Sol region. A Coruña surprisingly offers four schools
                despite being a smaller city. Como, Canet de Mar, and Platja d'Aro each have one school. Antibes
                requires a 15-20 minute commute but accesses excellent schools in Sophia Antipolis.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Tradeoffs -->
        <section class="section prose">
            <h3>The Unavoidable Tradeoffs</h3>
            <p>
                No city delivers everything. Como comes closest to balancing green climate, good skiing,
                quality schools, and Lake Como beauty—but at moderate-to-high cost and with only one school option.
                Nice and Antibes offer the best skiing access (90 minutes!) and most school choices but fail the
                green criterion and cost substantially more than alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Coruña solves affordability and delivers green Atlantic climate but makes skiing impossible.
                The Costa Brava towns offer affordable Mediterranean living with decent Pyrenees access but dry
                summers and limited school options. Málaga maximizes sunshine (325 days!) and luxury real estate
                but suffers from extreme aridity—481-581mm rainfall makes it one of Spain's driest cities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The choice isn't "which city is best"—it's "which compromises can we accept and which dealbreakers
                eliminate cities entirely." Green climate or Mediterranean sunshine? Skiing access or beach lifestyle?
                Affordability or luxury? School selection or single excellent school? The data can inform these
                tradeoffs, but it can't make the decision. That requires knowing which priorities truly matter when
                choosing where to build a life.

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <section class="section prose">
            <h3>Choosing What Matters</h3>
            <p>
                The analysis delivers clarity but not simplicity. Each city optimizes for different priorities:
                Como for balanced excellence at moderate-high cost, A Coruña for affordability with a green climate
                but no skiing, Nice for maximum optionality at maximum price, the Costa Brava for beach living
                and affordability accepting dry summers, Málaga for sunshine maximalists who prioritize weather
                over green landscapes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The right answer depends entirely on which tradeoffs feel acceptable and which feel like
                dealbreakers. Is 767mm of annual rainfall "not green enough," or is it "green enough for Mediterranean
                living"? Is 90-minute skiing access transformative, or is two hours perfectly adequate? Does
                €3,737 monthly cost feel justified by French Riviera lifestyle, or does €2,561 in A Coruña make
                more sense accepting that skiing becomes impossible?
            </p>
            <p>
                The data can't answer these questions—but it can frame them clearly enough that the answers
                become obvious. And that's worth knowing before packing the moving boxes.
